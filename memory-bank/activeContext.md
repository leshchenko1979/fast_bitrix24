## Current Work Focus

### Issue Resolution: Pagination with Rate Limiting
- **Status**: Fixed GitHub issue #265 - get_all method returning only 50 deals instead of full pagination
- **Problem**: Under strict rate limiting, the `MultipleServerRequestHandler` was preventing pagination from continuing
- **Root Cause**: The `GetAllUserRequest` was using batch requests for pagination, but rate limiting prevented batch processing from working correctly
- **Solution**: Moved hybrid batching/individual fallback logic to `MultipleServerRequestHandler` itself, making it robust and reusable
- **Implementation**:
  - `MultipleServerRequestHandler` now stores original items and expected count during initialization
  - Automatically falls back to individual requests when batching fails due to rate limiting
  - Handles various result types (lists, dicts, integers) gracefully
  - Fixed progress bar to work with iterators
- **Impact**: Pagination now works correctly even under strict rate limiting conditions while maintaining performance benefits of batching

### Memory Bank Initialization
- **Status**: Creating comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
- **Goal**: Establish complete project context for future development sessions
- **Progress**: Core files created (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)

### Project Understanding
- **Current State**: High-performance Python API wrapper for Bitrix24 REST API
- **Maturity**: Well-established library with active development and user base
- **Adoption**: Used by major companies including Yandex
- **Performance**: Achieves thousands of elements per second on large datasets

## Recent Changes

### Bug Fixes
- **ChainMap JSON Serialization Fix**: Fixed JSON serialization error when falling back to individual requests
  - **Problem**: ChainMap objects created by `CallUserRequest.prepare_item_list()` were not JSON serializable when falling back to individual requests
  - **Root Cause**: `_fallback_to_individual_requests` method was passing ChainMap objects directly to `single_request` without conversion
  - **Solution**: Added ChainMap detection and conversion to regular dictionaries before sending to server
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "Object of type ChainMap is not JSON serializable" errors during rate limiting fallbacks
  - **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test `test_chainmap_serialization_in_fallback` to verify the fix

- **Server Response Formatting Fix**: Fixed batch response handling for methods returning simple values (like `lists.element.add`)
  - **Problem**: Batch responses for methods returning simple values (IDs) were not being processed correctly
  - **Root Cause**: `extract_from_batch_response` method wasn't handling simple values properly in batch responses
  - **Solution**: Enhanced batch response parsing to handle simple values (integers, strings) in addition to complex objects
  - **Impact**: Batch calls to methods like `lists.element.add` now correctly return all IDs as a tuple/list instead of just the first value
  - **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test `test_lists_element_add_batch` to verify the fix
