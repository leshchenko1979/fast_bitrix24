# Progress: fast_bitrix24

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- **High-Speed Data Exchange**: Achieves thousands of elements per second on large datasets
- **Automatic Request Batching**: Reduces required server requests by packaging them into batches
- **Parallel Processing**: Sends batches to server in parallel, not sequentially
- **Advanced Pagination Strategies**: Accelerates data extraction by orders of magnitude
- **Server Failure Prevention**: Respects all Bitrix24 rate limiting policies
- **Automatic Throttling**: Reduces speed automatically when server returns errors
- **Code Convenience**: High-level list methods to reduce required code to one line
- **Parameter Validation**: Checks request parameters for correctness to ease debugging
- **Progress Visualization**: Automatic progress bars with tqdm showing processed elements and time
- **OAuth Authorization**: Track token expiration and auto-refresh for application work
- **Dual Client Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous clients
- **Enterprise Optimization**: Support for higher request speeds on Enterprise accounts

### Recent Fixes
- **ChainMap JSON Serialization Fix**: Fixed JSON serialization error when falling back to individual requests
  - **Problem**: ChainMap objects created by `CallUserRequest.prepare_item_list()` were not JSON serializable when falling back to individual requests
  - **Root Cause**: `_fallback_to_individual_requests` method was passing ChainMap objects directly to `single_request` without conversion
  - **Solution**: Added ChainMap detection and conversion to regular dictionaries before sending to server
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "Object of type ChainMap is not JSON serializable" errors during rate limiting fallbacks
  - **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test `test_chainmap_serialization_in_fallback` to verify the fix

- **Server Response Formatting Fix**: Fixed batch response handling for methods returning simple values (like `lists.element.add`)
  - **Problem**: Batch responses for methods returning simple values (IDs) were not being processed correctly
  - **Root Cause**: `extract_from_batch_response` method wasn't handling simple values properly in batch responses
  - **Solution**: Enhanced batch response parsing to handle simple values (integers, strings) in addition to complex objects
  - **Impact**: Batch calls to methods like `lists.element.add` now correctly return all IDs as a tuple/list instead of just the first value
  - **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test `test_lists_element_add_batch` to verify the fix

- **Issue #265**: Fixed pagination with rate limiting - get_all method now returns all results even under strict rate limiting
  - **Problem**: Under strict rate limiting, pagination was stopping after first page (50 items)
  - **Solution**: Moved hybrid batching/individual fallback logic to `MultipleServerRequestHandler` itself
  - **Implementation**:
    - `MultipleServerRequestHandler` stores original items and expected count during initialization
    - Automatically falls back to individual requests when batching fails due to rate limiting
    - Handles various result types (lists, dicts, integers) gracefully
    - Fixed progress bar to work with iterators
  - **Impact**: Pagination now works correctly regardless of rate limiting settings while maintaining performance benefits of batching

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues
- **ChainMap JSON Serialization Fix**: JSON serialization error in fallback mode - FIXED
  - **Description**: ChainMap objects were not JSON serializable when falling back to individual requests due to rate limiting
  - **Root Cause**: `_fallback_to_individual_requests` method was passing ChainMap objects directly to server without conversion
  - **Solution**: Added ChainMap detection and conversion to regular dictionaries before sending to server
  - **Status**: RESOLVED

- **Server Response Formatting Fix**: Batch response handling for simple values - FIXED
  - **Description**: Batch responses for methods returning simple values (like `lists.element.add`) were not being processed correctly
  - **Root Cause**: `extract_from_batch_response` method wasn't handling simple values properly
  - **Solution**: Enhanced batch response parsing to handle simple values (integers, strings) in addition to complex objects
  - **Status**: RESOLVED

- **Issue #265**: Pagination with rate limiting - FIXED
  - **Description**: get_all method was returning only 50 deals instead of full pagination
  - **Root Cause**: Batch processing was incompatible with strict rate limiting
  - **Solution**: Switched to individual requests for pagination
  - **Status**: RESOLVED

### Potential Issues
- **Rate Limiting Edge Cases**: Very strict rate limiting might still cause issues in some scenarios
- **Memory Usage**: Large datasets might consume significant memory
- **SSL Issues**: Some environments might have SSL certificate issues
- **Async Runtime**: Event loop management in different environments

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async-First Design**: Core functionality in `BitrixAsync` with sync wrapper
- **Request Batching**: Automatic batching of up to 50 requests per batch
- **Rate Limiting**: Dual rate limiting (Leaky Bucket + Sliding Window)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery
- **Parameter Validation**: Pre-request validation for better debugging

### Recent Changes
- **Pagination Fix**: Modified `GetAllUserRequest` to use individual requests instead of batch requests for pagination
- **Rate Limiting Enhancement**: Added fallback logic to ensure at least one request can proceed under strict rate limiting
- **Memory Bank**: Established comprehensive project documentation system

### Future Considerations
- **Performance Optimization**: Further speed improvements possible
- **Feature Expansion**: Additional Bitrix24 API features
- **Enterprise Features**: Enhanced Enterprise account support
- **Community Growth**: Expand user base and community engagement
